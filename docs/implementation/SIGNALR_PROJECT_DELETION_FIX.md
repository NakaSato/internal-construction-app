# SignalR Real-time Project Deletion Fix

## Problem
When projects were deleted via the API, the SignalR real-time updates were not reflecting the deletions in the UI, requiring manual refresh to see the changes.

## Solution
We've implemented several improvements to ensure real-time updates work properly for project deletions:

1. **Fixed Project Deletion Handler**: 
   - Improved the `_onRealTimeProjectDeletedReceived` handler in `ProjectBloc` to properly update the UI when projects are deleted.
   - Added better logging to track the deletion event flow.
   - Added verification of project deletion through a backend check.

2. **Added Project Repository Verification Method**:
   - Added `verifyProjectDeleted` method to confirm projects are truly deleted on the backend.
   - This helps diagnose issues where the SignalR event might fire but the project still exists.

3. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Enhanced logging in SignalR event handlers to better identify when deletion events occur.
   - Added state handling for when users are viewing a project that gets deleted.

4. **Force Refresh Option**:
   - Added a "Force Refresh" button in the UI that clears the cache and reloads data.
   - This gives users a manual fallback if real-time updates aren't functioning.

5. **Testing Utilities**:
   - Created a `test_signalr_project_deletion.sh` script to simulate SignalR deletion events.
   - Provided diagnostic steps for troubleshooting SignalR update issues.

## Results

Real-time project deletion now works through these mechanisms:

1. When a project is deleted via the API, the SignalR hub sends a `projectDeleted` event.
2. The `SignalRService` receives this event and routes it to the `UniversalRealtimeHandler`.
3. The handler converts it to a `RealTimeProjectDeletedReceived` event for the `ProjectBloc`.
4. The bloc filters out the deleted project from the list and updates the `ProjectsLoaded` state.
5. The UI automatically updates to reflect the deletion.

If SignalR updates fail for any reason, users can now click the "Force Refresh" button to manually synchronize the UI with the backend data.

## Next Steps

- Monitor SignalR performance in production to ensure deletion events are properly propagated.
- Consider implementing a periodic background refresh as an additional failsafe.
- Add more detailed diagnostic logging in production builds to help identify intermittent issues.
